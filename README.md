Applying Machine Learning to Generative Architectural Design

[Here's the live website](http://git-to-s3-fresheyes.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

This cluster brings recent developments in machine learning (ML) to bear on generative architectural design. To improve the utility of artificial intelligence as a creative partner for design, we have brought together experts from architectural design practice, ML engineering, and design methods research, and have developed methods for the incorporation of user-generated image-based ML recognition models into the evaluation step of a traditional generative design workflow. While existing research has integrated low-level ML operations into the parametric design environment with a level of success, this proposal uniquely links the familiar environment of Grasshopper with cloud-hosted models trained using the high-level and relatively user-friendly Tensorflow framework.
