This cluster proposes the synthesis of 
ML and Generative Architectural Design

I could perhaps situate this work 
in terms of David Benjamin's presentation this morning
specifically his "twin mirror" project,
which exposes the data bais problem in machine learning

This cluster recognizes that this bias exists,
and seeks to leverage it 
as a locus of a new form of subjectivity in design

It will come as no surprise 
to anyone in this room 
that machine learning has made 
rapid gains in recent years.

[[section]]

This sequence, 
a portion of which we saw earlier
clearly demonstrates this.

For those that weren't here,
I should reiterate that 
each of these images was generated by a computer, 
not as the manipulation of an existing photo, 
but rather as an entirely new form 
that matches an existing pattern of known forms
drawn from experience.

These are images that the computer has "drawn", on its own.

I'd like you to keep in mind
the speed of the progress shown here 
especially when I present the work of the cluster 
later in the talk

For now, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 
the ramifications of a computer 
that is capable of synthesizing images,
of "drawing" pictures 
with such fidelity.

This thought is a little jarring.

[[section]]

At least it is to me.
I first studied architecture in the 1990s,
when drawing as an activity was in transition 
from things like 
pencil and vellum, 
ink and mylar 

to something very different. 

the mode of authorship 
enabled by traditional drawing tools 
seemed at the time 
to be a straightforward affair.

this is a mode that remains well described 
by what I now understand as 
the 'reflective loop' of design activity


[[section]]

despite all the changes 
brought about by the digital transformation 
of the early 2000's
this understanding of design activity 
as an iterative cycle of making and seeing
basically held true

even as computers offered new forms of acting
from working indirectly on the shape of curves via control points
to assembling ornate chains of logic via scripting

they left the seeing to us humans


[[section]]

in the late 2000s,
the advent of parametric modeling 
changed things slightly


[[section]]


a new form of design action 
found its way into practical application
that formalized not only computational modes of acting,
but also formalized modes of "seeing" (in a sense)
and also the mechanisms of iteration

this design method, novel in the early 2000s, 
has come to be known as generative design

[[section]]

Generative Design in architecture 
is widely understood as a three-stage cycle:

in the generation step, 
new potential forms are proposed 
using a computational process

in the evaluation step,
the performance of these forms are quantified
again relying on computational analysis 
rather than the subjective eye of the designer

and in the iteration step, 
parameters of generation are manipulated 
to find better results.

The work presented by David this morning 
illustrates this process clearly


[[section]]

This approach typically employs 
a combination of 
parametric, 
simulation, and 
optimization tools.

this is where the contribution of the cluster,
in synthesizing ML and Generative Design, 
comes into play


[[section]]

This cluster proposes a modest modification
of the generative design process.

We swap out the evaluation step of the cycle
which is typically the domain of architectural simulation 
for a machine learning process,
specifically a neural net trained on image classification
of one form or another

So, what is ML, and how can it fit into this process?

While we've heard a lot about ML today,
I'll take this chance to offer my favorite definition:


[[section]]

ML is learning through observation,
in which patterns are mapped onto other patterns
without any intervening representations.


[[section]]


This process is different enough 
from traditional methods for evaluation,
as to warrant an adjustment of 
the terms of generative design.

And so we re-define the generative design cycle as 
actor, critic, stage.


[[section]]

As before, 
an actor generates new forms, 
and describes them in a format preferred by ML

The issue of format is a crucial one.

For a variety of reasons,
the most developed ML models 
relevant to architectural design
operate on images.

Its not coincidence that the projects we saw presented this morning
all operated on images
images of wood
images of people

For this reason,
we are content for now 
to insist that our actor
re-present architectural form as image



[[section]]

And so,
one important contribution of the cluster 
involves the developing and testing 
of methods for describing architectural forms and spaces 
as images.



[[section]]

Moving on the evaluation step,
we define a critic as a process that evaluates forms 
based on patterns and types learned from experience.

I should emphasize that the importance of training a critic 
should not be underestimated.

This is an important new locus of creative action in design,
an important new form of subjectivity
and to cede this space to existing processes and models
would be a huge loss for architectural design.

If architects are to remain relevant in the age of ML
We MUST take ownership of the training of critics.



[[section]]


to ensure that the participants in this workshop 
are not disenfranchised 
by an inability to train models 
relevant to them, 
we partnered with a company called Lobe
which sponsored our cluster

Lobe provided an essential platform 
for training ML models 
relevant to architectural evaluation. 

As we see here,
Lobe is a web-based visual tool for 
constructing models
training them
and allowing them to serve up predictions

we might think of it as something like this:
as Grasshopper is to Rhino
so Lobe is to Tensorflow

More valuable than this software, 
the most important contribution that Lobe made to the cluster 
was loaning us its CEO, Adam Menges, 
who served as one of the cluster champions
and a core member of our group from the beginning



[[section]]

Finally, we define a stage 
as the system which brings together actor and critic, 
allowing an actor to progressively improve his performance.

Here, traditional optimization techniques are employed, 
which I'm sure all of us in the room understand perfectly well.


[[section]]

So, just to illustrate
how all these pieces go together,
we see in this animation an actor and critic 
coming together on a stage.

Here, a critic was trained on 3d models
such as the ones we see on the right
that describe typologies of detached single-family homes
cape cod house
shotgun
dogtrot
or, in homage to Toronto the Bay and Gable

The job of the critic 
is to evaluate the performance of an actor, 
which, in this case, is capable of generating a range of house-like forms, 
such as the ones we see flashing by on the right.



[[section]]


These two intelligences 
are brought together in an optimization, 
wherein the actor generates new potential house forms, 
these forms are scored by the critic 
in terms of how much they resemble a known type of house, 
such as the California Eichler style shown here
and then the process iterates in a classic optimization.


[[section]]

and so,
by modestly adjusting 
the nature of the evaluation step 
of the generative design process,

we find a potential way forward 
from optimization for quantifiable objectives, 
as is typical in generative design
to more qualitative ones, 
such as architectural typology or spatial experience

    

[[section]]

So this is the framework 
that was introduced to cluster participants,
who, over the course of the four-day workshop, 
probed
extended
exploded and re-assembled 
this framework toward a variety of individual ends.

The time I have remaining 
doesn't begin to do justice 
to the work completed in this time.

I'd like to invite everyone upstairs to our exhibit 
where participants will be on hand to talk about their work
and to visit the website for the cluster
